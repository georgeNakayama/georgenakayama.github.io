 I am a third year undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in mathematics. I am fortunate work with [Prof. Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/). I am generally interested in computer vision, graphics and machine learning. My recent research focuses on the representation and generation of objects/scenes for 2D and 3D content creation. Specifically, I have worked on controllable shape generation and 2D image segmentation. I also had to pleasure working with [Prof. Shimin Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm) as a visiting student at Tsinghua University during the summer of 2022.
