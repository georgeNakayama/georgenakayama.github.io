 I am a third year undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in mathematics. I am fortunate work with [Prof. Leonidas Guibas](https://geometry.stanford.edu/). I am generally interested in computer vision, graphics and machine learning. My recent research focuses on the representation and generation of objects/scenes for 2D and 3D content creation. Specifically, I have worked on controllable shape generation and 2D image segmentation. I also had to pleasure working with [Prof. Shimin Hu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/shimin.htm) as a visiting student at Tsinghua University during the summer of 2022. 

 I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Mikaela Uy](https://mikacuy.github.io/) at Stanford, and by [Jiahui Huang](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~huangjh/) and Guo-wei Yang at Tsinghua university. They introduced me to the wonderfully rich field of computer science research.
